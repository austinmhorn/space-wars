# This script locates the leafy library
# ------------------------------------
#
# Usage
# -----
#
# You can enforce a specific version, one of either MAJOR.MINOR.REVISION,
# MAJOR.MINOR or only MAJOR. If nothing is specified, the version won't
# be checked i.e. any version will be accepted. leafy does not consist of
# multiple components, so specifying COMPONENTS is not required.
#
# Example:
#   find_package( leafy )       // no specific version
#   find_package( leafy 0.2 )   // any 0.2 version
#   find_package( leafy 0.2.3 ) // version 0.2.3 or greater
#
# By default, the dynamic version of leafy will be found. To find the static
# version instead, you must set the LEAFY_STATIC_LIBRARIES variable to TRUE
# before calling find_package( leafy ). In that case, LEAFY_STATIC will also be
# defined by this script.
#
# Example:
#   set( LEAFY_STATIC_LIBRARIES TRUE )
#   find_package( leafy )
#
# Since you have to link all of leafy's dependencies when you link leafy
# statically, the variable LEAFY_DEPENDENCIES is also defined. See below
# for a detailed description.
#
# On Mac OS X if LEAFY_STATIC_LIBRARIES is not set to TRUE then by default CMake
# will search for frameworks unless CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK is set to "NEVER".
# Please refer to CMake documentation for more details.
# Moreover, keep in mind that leafy frameworks are only available as release
# libraries unlike dylibs which are available for both release and debug modes.
#
# If leafy is not installed in a standard path, you can use the LEAFY_ROOT
# CMake (or environment) variable to tell CMake where to look for leafy.
#
# Output
# ------
#
# This script defines the following variables:
#   - LEAFY_LIBRARY_DEBUG:   the path to the debug library
#   - LEAFY_LIBRARY_RELEASE: the path to the release library
#   - LEAFY_LIBRARY:         the path to the library to link to
#   - LEAFY_FOUND:           TRUE if the leafy library is found
#   - LEAFY_INCLUDE_DIR:     the path where leafy headers are located (the directory containing the leafy/Config.hpp file)
#   - LEAFY_DEPENDENCIES:    the list of libraries leafy depends on, in case of static linking
#
# Example (dynamic linking):
#   find_package( leafy REQUIRED )
#   include_directories( ${LEAFY_INCLUDE_DIR} )
#   add_executable( myapp ... )
#   target_link_libraries( myapp ${LEAFY_LIBRARY} ... )
#
# Example (static linking):
#   set( LEAFY_STATIC_LIBRARIES TRUE )
#   find_package( leafy REQUIRED )
#   include_directories( ${LEAFY_INCLUDE_DIR} )
#   add_executable( myapp ... )
#   target_link_libraries( myapp ${LEAFY_LIBRARY} ${LEAFY_DEPENDENCIES} ... )
